          I found this exercise to be both challenging and fun. I didn&apos;t
          love questions 2 and 3, as I felt they were quite broad and could go
          many ways, so I had difficulty deciding on how I wanted to answer
          them, but they did force me to do some more research into Vercel in
          these specific areas, which I think was beneficial for my
          understanding of the product as a whole. Other than that, I think it
          did a great job of encompassing what I could expect while working at
          Vercel.

        <p>
          Oh, and I did find it funny that the customer&apos;s response in
          question 5 implied that I was asking questions, which forced me to go
          back and alter my response as I was initially recommending only a
          solution without asking for more details. After realizing this, I went
          back and determined I should not assume they were trying to implement
          the redirect the way that I was, and that there are actually multiple
          paths to achieve the desired result.
