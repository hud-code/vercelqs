              I&apos;m so frustrated. I&apos;ve been trying to make this work
              for hours and I just can&apos;t figure it out. It must be a
              platform issue so why don't you just fix it for me instead of
              asking me questions.

        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          <br /> Thank you for your response - I&apos;m sorry to hear
          you&apos;re still having difficulty with implementing this change.

          I understand the questions I&apos;m asking may not seem relevant or
          may appear to delay fixing the issue, but I assure you that these will
          help us in finding and resolving the issue quickly.
        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <p>
          If this is a highly urgent issue and needs resolution quickly, I think
          it would be be beneficial to have a conference call* so that we are
          able to get a better understanding of your code and get better context
          of the issue.
        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <p>
          In the meantime, providing answers to the questions will greatly
          increase our ability to assist you. I look forward to hearing from you
          soon.
        </p>{" "}

        <p>Cheers, </p>
